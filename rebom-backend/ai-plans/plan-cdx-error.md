# Plan for Resolving 'Cannot find namespace 'CDX'' Error

## Notes
- The user encountered a TypeScript error: "Cannot find namespace 'CDX'" in `src\bomService.ts` line 70.
- The error typically means that the namespace 'CDX' is not defined or imported in the current file or project.
- The user is working in a Node.js TypeScript backend project.
- In `validateBom.ts`, `CDX` is imported from `@cyclonedx/cyclonedx-library`.
- `bomService.ts` uses `validateBom`, but does not import `CDX` itself.
- Added import for CDX in `bomService.ts` and updated usage to `CDX.Models.Bom`.

## Task List
- [x] Investigate where 'CDX' is supposed to be defined or imported from
- [x] Check if there is a missing import or type definition for 'CDX'
- [x] Suggest or implement a fix (add import, define namespace, or install types)
- [ ] Verify the fix resolves the error in `bomService.ts`

## Current Goal
Verify fix and handle any further CDX-related errors
