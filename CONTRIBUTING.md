# Welcome to ReARM contributing guide <!-- omit in toc -->

Note: This Contributing guide is based on [GitHub Docs Contributing guide](https://github.com/github/docs).

Thank you for investing your time in contributing to ReARM!

Read our [Code of Conduct](./CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to keep our community approachable and respectable.

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## New contributor guide

To get an overview of the project, read the [README](../README.md) file. Here are some resources to help you get started with open source contributions:

- [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/git-basics/set-up-git)
- [Trunk-Based Development]([https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/using-github/github-flow](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/))

### Issues

#### Create a new issue

If you spot a problem with ReARM, first check if a corresponding issue exists in [open issues](https://github.com/relizaio/rearm/issues).
If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue.

#### Solve an issue

Scan through our [existing issues]([https://github.com/github/docs/issues](https://github.com/relizaio/rearm/issues)) to find one that interests you. 
If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Make Changes

1. Fork the repository.
- Using the command line:
  - [Fork the repo](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) so that you can make your changes without affecting the original project until you're ready to merge them.
2. Create a working branch and start with your changes!

### Commit your update

Commit the changes once you are happy with them.

### Pull Request

When you're finished with the changes, create a pull request, also known as a PR.
- Enable the checkbox to [allow maintainer edits](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork) so the branch can be updated for a merge.
Once you submit your PR, a Docs team member will review your proposal. We may ask questions or request additional information.
- We may ask for changes to be made before a PR can be merged, either using [suggested changes](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/incorporating-feedback-in-your-pull-request) or pull request comments. You can apply suggested changes directly through the UI. You can make any other changes in your fork, then commit them to your branch.
- As you update your PR and apply changes, mark each conversation as [resolved](https://docs.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/commenting-on-a-pull-request#resolving-conversations).
- If you run into any merge issues, checkout this [git tutorial](https://github.com/skills/resolve-merge-conflicts) to help you resolve merge conflicts and other issues.

### Your PR is merged!

Congratulations :tada::tada: The ReARM team thanks you :sparkles:.

Once your PR is merged, your changes will be added to the next ReARM release based on TBD model.
