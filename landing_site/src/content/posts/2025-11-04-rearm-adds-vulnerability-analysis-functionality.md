title: "New Major ReARM Release Includes Vulnerability Analysis Functionality"

We're excited to announce a major release of [ReARM CE (v25.11.9)](https://github.com/relizaio/rearm/releases/tag/25.11.9) and ReARM Pro (v25.11.7).

This release includes new built-in vulnerability triage and analysis functionality and updated Transparency Exchange API [discovery logic](https://github.com/CycloneDX/transparency-exchange-api/pull/196).

It is now possible to add an analysis trail for every finding (vulnerability, violation or weakness), specifying where the finding is exploitable, false positive or not affecting particular release. Analysis can be scoped to the organization as a whole, specific component or product, branch or a single release.

Findings marked as false positive or not affected show up as suppressed in the UI.

It is also possible to provide aliasing details for vulnerabilities to further reduce noise.
