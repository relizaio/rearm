We have prepared a comparison chart showing differences between ReARM and tools using traditional approach to SBOMs / xBOMs. 

Key distinction is that ReARM maintains xBOM documents per each release, while majority of other tools keep single SBOM document per the whole project, sometimes calling it "Dynamic SBOM". Having just a single SBOM per project makes it nearly impossible to describe actual state of live environments running previously shipped software versions. ReARM solves this problem by clearly indicating xBOM documents that belong to each software or hardware version.

See detailed comparison chart below:
