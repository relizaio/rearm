We've shipped ReARM Pro 25.08.20 and ReARM CE 25.08.23. This release focuses on better SBOM awareness and release transparency. 

Key new functionality is that you can now see and be alerted on SBOM changes between releases. If dependencies changed, ReARM will send you a Slack or MS Teams notification with details.

There is also a new section in the release view highlighting SBOM level changes between releases. We've recorded a video to show you how it works [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RfKVd-F7_0U).

We have also added human readable SBOM exports in Excel and CSV formats. This will be very useful for certain industries such as Medical Devices where human readable SBOMs are required alongside machine readable ones for compliance purposes.

Another important addition to ReARM is searching releases by SBOM components. See this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a1VPDgqG1FA) for more details.
