We're excited to announce a major release of ReARM Pro (v26.01.173) and [ReARM CE (v26.01.129)](https://github.com/relizaio/rearm/releases/tag/26.01.129).

This release introduces VDR (Vulnerability Disclosure Report) export capabilities, comprehensive changelog tracking for vulnerabilities and SBOM components, and numerous other improvements.

## Key Highlights

**VDR Export for Releases**
- Export Vulnerability Disclosure Reports in [CycloneDX](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr/) or PDF formats directly from your releases. ReARM now also supports PDF export for finding views.
- Simplifies compliance reporting and vulnerability communication with stakeholders.

**Vulnerability and SBOM Component Changelogs**
- Previously, ReARM provided changelogs for commits. Now, in addition to that you can also track changes to vulnerabilities and SBOM components over time.
- Additionally, we introduced organization-wide changelog view that provides visibility across all your products and components.

## New Features

**Programmatic Artifact Management**
- Add artifacts programmatically to existing releases via API, enabling seamless CI/CD integration.

**BEAR Enrichment Integration**
- Integration for [BEAR (Bom Enrichment and Augmentation by Reliza)](https://github.com/relizaio/bear) enrichment within ReARM - that updates supplier and licensing details for your SBOMs.

**Async Dependency-Track Processing**
- Improved performance with asynchronous processing for Dependency-Track integrations.

**Organization-wide Violation Ignore Patterns**
- Define ignore patterns at the organization level to filter out known acceptable violations.

**Enhanced Visualizations**
- Interactive releases per day chart
- Full page views of findings over time and releases per day charts
- Findings over time and releases per day charts now available in component and product views

**UI Improvements**
- 3-way collapsible view when displaying releases allowing to reduce visual clutter
- Display artifact change details in release history

Additionally, this new release of ReARM includes a number of bug fixes and improvements, specifically tweaks to aggregation logic and better handling of finding provenance.
