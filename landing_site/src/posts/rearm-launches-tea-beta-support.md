## ReARM Announces Implementation of OWASP Transparency Exchange API (TEA)

We’re excited to announce that Project ReARM by Reliza now includes implementation of [OWASP Transparency Exchange API (TEA)](https://github.com/CycloneDX/transparency-exchange-api/), Beta 1 — marking a significant step forward in software supply chain transparency and interoperability.

The OWASP TEA standard provides a unified interface for tools to publish and retrieve software transparency metadata, including SBOMs / xBOMs and attestations. As software supply chain threats continue to rise, TEA aims to establish a vendor-neutral way to expose and query security-critical metadata across ecosystems.

ReARM implementation allows to present ReARM data via standardized TEA API. This gives ReARM users the flexibility to retrieve metadata using the ReARM CLI, GraphQL API, or the standardized TEA API. 

As the TEA standard evolves, ReARM will update support to new versions accordingly. Reliza is also planning to maintain its role as one of the key contributors to the TEA standard itself.

> “We’re proud to lead the charge in adopting OWASP TEA,” said Pavel Shukhman, CEO and Co-Founder of Reliza. “This API is a game-changer for security professionals, compliance teams, DevSecOps and DevOps specialists who need verifiable, standards-based Supply Chain transparency.”

The TEA implementation is now live on ReARM demo and may be enabled on ReARM Community Edition. To learn more about the current status of TEA implementation, refer to the TEA section of ReARM Documentation [here](https://docs.rearmhq.com/tea/index.html).
