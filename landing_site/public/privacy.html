                        <ul>

                        <p>When retention is no longer necessary, we will delete or anonymize the data. If deletion is not possible (for example, because the data is stored in backup archives), we will securely store it and isolate it from further processing until deletion is possible.</p>

                        <p>Your information, including Personal Data, may be transferred to and maintained on computers located outside of your state, province, country or other governmental jurisdiction where data protection laws may differ from those of your jurisdiction.</p>

                        Your Data Protection Rights under the California Privacy Protection Act (CalOPPA)
                        CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the United States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information from California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more at: https://consumercal.org/about-cfc/cfc-education-foundation/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa-3/
                        According to CalOPPA we agree to the following:
                        users can visit our site anonymously;
                        our Privacy Policy link includes the word "Privacy", and can easily be found on the page specified above on the home page of our website;
                        users will be notified of any privacy policy changes on our Privacy Policy Page;
                        users are able to change their personal information by emailing us at info@reliza.io.
                        Our Policy on "Do Not Track" (DNT) Signals:
                        While some browsers offer a Do Not Track (DNT) setting, there is currently no industry standard for how websites should respond to such signals. At this time, we do not respond to DNT signals. You can control non-essential cookies and similar technologies through our Cookie Settings (where available) and your browser settings.
                        Your Data Protection Rights under the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)
                        If you are a California resident, you are entitled to learn what data we collect about you, ask to delete your data and not to sell (share) it. To exercise your data protection rights, you can make certain requests and ask us:
                        What personal information we have about you. If you make this request, we will return to you:

                        To delete your personal information.
